# Model View Pizza

> A practical application of JavaScript MV\* Frameworks... with pizza

## About this Project

This project came from a desire to learn and evaluate each Model-View-* JavaScript framework.  I started to write my own and decided that I should at least learn 10 of them before I do something so drastic. To properly evaluate a framework, I needed something that was simple enough to understand within a few minutes of reading it, but that was complex enough to discover pain points during development.  

The idea for creating a pizza customization came from thinking about all of this and then noticing that pizza screens are complex enough to do this while ordering a pizza.  I hope that anyone who comes here can benefit from the work I am putting into it.

## Suggestions/Edits

If you know how the code could better represent the framework or if there is a bug, send me a pull request or if you are feeling particularly lazy, send me a message on [Twitter (@notoriousb1t)](https://twitter.com/notoriousb1t).  I welcome your suggestions.
